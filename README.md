# Text Editor

## Description

This text editor is a progressive web app (PWA) that runs in the browser. It also features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The app will function offline and uses an IndexedDB database that allow users to get and store data there.
